Ð¡alculation of the optimal movement of the orthosis with OpenSim4

### Dependenses
- First you need to collect [opensim-core](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core) for use from the CMD.
- The system on which everything has been tested:
    1. Windows 10
    2. Python 3.9.6
    3. Visual Studio 15 2017
    4. OpenSim 4.0

To use just run `python Release.py` in the project directory.
